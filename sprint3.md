# Sprint 3 Report - GeoFence Project

## Team Achievements

### Authentication Improvements
- Implemented JWT token-based authentication system
- Added token refresh mechanism
- Enhanced security with robust authentication middleware

### Geofence Management Enhancements
- Developed more sophisticated spatial query capabilities
- Implemented geofence entry/exit event tracking
- Added support for advanced geofence shape definitions

### Content Management
- Created endpoints for content CRUD operations within geofences
- Implemented support for multiple content types
- Initialized basic content moderation functionality

## Backend Unit Tests

### Authentication Tests
- `TestJWTTokenGeneration` - Verify JWT token creation
- `TestTokenRefresh` - Test token refresh mechanism
- `TestAuthMiddleware` - Validate authentication middleware functionality

### Geofence Tests
- `TestAdvancedSpatialQueries` - Test complex geospatial queries
- `TestGeofenceEntryExitEvents` - Validate geofence boundary detection
- `TestGeofenceShapeSupport` - Verify support for different geofence shapes

### Content Management Tests
- `TestContentCRUDOperations` - Test content creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
- `TestContentTypeSupport` - Validate support for different content types
- `TestContentModeration` - Basic content moderation test cases

## Frontend Unit Tests

### Authentication
- `testUserLogin` - Verify user login functionality
- `testTokenManagement` - Test JWT token handling
- `testAuthErrorHandling` - Validate authentication error scenarios

### Geofence Interactions
- `testGeofenceCreation` - Verify geofence creation process
- `testNearbyGeofenceRetrieval` - Test nearby geofence discovery
- `testGeofenceBoundaryDetection` - Validate geofence entry/exit detection

### Content Management
- `testContentSubmission` - Verify content submission within geofences
- `testContentRetrieval` - Test content retrieval functionality
- `testContentTypeRendering` - Validate rendering of different content types

## API Documentation Updates

### New Endpoints
- `/auth/refresh` - Token refresh endpoint
- `/content` - Content management endpoints
- `/geofences/events` - Geofence entry/exit event tracking

### Authentication Headers
```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
X-Refresh-Token: <refresh_token>
```

## Challenges Overcome
- Implemented complex geospatial querying
- Enhanced security with robust token management
- Developed flexible content management system

## Future Roadmap
- Implement advanced content moderation AI
- Develop more granular role-based access control
- Optimize geospatial query performance
- Expand content type support

## Individual Contributions
